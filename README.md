My end-of-year project for First Year Software Development

All exercises consist of simple Java programs. Some ask for prompts while others have pre-programmed variables or arrays

Exercise 8 acts as a main menu for the rest of the programs so you don't have to waste time running each exercise individually

Or alternatively, download it and run it on a Java program such as TextPad

If using TextPad you must also download the Java SE Development Kit Version 8
